I have updated the snake hyperlink to be run in the same page so that the user finds easy to use
When the score is highest it is shown by catching from the data base inorder to do see so snake.js when the gamescore.php is being loaded I passed
score on to the url to make it happen. There was no way around

for the database i have used columns id, username,password,email,snake_score so please update the score according
